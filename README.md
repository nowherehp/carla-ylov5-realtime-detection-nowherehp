this project aiming for real-time object detection and real time car distance measurment

Logics of the project
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4758ca2a-56c5-4120-b75e-fa2462b9e600)

using web scraper and a automatic pics capture script to get pics training yolov5.

using simple distance algorithm to calculate the focal length of the rbg cam. using the
heights of the each car as the base measurment to calculate the real time distance.
